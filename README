# STRPM

It contains a pytorch implementation of the following paper:

* STRPM: A SpatioTemporal Residual Predictive Model for High-Resolution Video Prediction.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Quick Start

For quick start, the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15D7sHmhBHpqX7nNiJ8p1hzowS0RQqtvp/view?usp=sharing) and the [example data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iairxo8iCMO__-_yupwgXbdTAMbdk45l/view?usp=sharing) are needed to be downloaded to the following folders,

To test our model on the UCF Sport dataset, run the code in the PowerShell using:

```
python STRPM_run.py --dataset ucfsport
```

The predictions from the UCF Sport dataset are shown as follows (ground truth (top) and predictions (bottom))

To test our model on the Human3.6M dataset, run the code in the PowerShell using:

```
python STRPM_run.py --dataset human36m
```

To test our model on the SJTU4K dataset, run the code in the PowerShell using:

```
python STRPM_run.py --dataset sjtu4k
```

The predicted results will be saved into path results/.
